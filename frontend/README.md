ian.tech is my personal website. Here you'll find my resume, and some info about me.

## Site Development

I built this site by hand! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”¨ I am not a great creative designer by any means, so naturally I looked to others for help. Lucie Harberer [@lihbr](https://lihbr.com)'s new personal blog inspired the design, but no code was copied, only design and some functional concepts.

Aside from that all of the content is my own, please browse around, there might be an interesting thing or two.

The inspiration for building this site came from trying to update my resume. I recently have learned Nuxt 3 since it was released last November, and since I enjoy building things in Nuxt I thought I'd put my resume online. At the same time I picked up on Strapi and decided to build the content out with that.

Nuxt 3 is great, I really enjoy using it and the great features it offers to help build sites and web apps quickly. I recently took some courses in Vue 3 as well from Vue Mastery, their content and teachers are really good.
