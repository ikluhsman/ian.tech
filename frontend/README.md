# about ian.tech

ian.tech is my personal website. Here you'll find my resume, and some info about me.

## site development

I built this site by hand! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”¨ I am not a great creative designer by any means, so naturally I looked to others for help. Lucie Harberer [@lihbr](https://lihbr.com)'s new personal blog inspired the design though no code was copied, only design and some functional concepts. Aside from that all of the content is my own, please browse around, there might be an interesting thing or two for you to see. I started building this site when I got bored trying to write a traditional resume. I thought why not build something cool with unique content? And solIt can now be downloaded as a file in PDF or JSON format.
