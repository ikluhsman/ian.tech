## HI

ian.tech is my personal website. Here you'll find my resume, and some info about me.

## Site Development

## Inspiration

I built this site by hand, not using any kind of content manager, its **mostly** my code. I am not a great creative designer by any means, so naturally I stole the site's creative design from someone else. Lucie Harberer [@lihbr](https://lihbr.com) inspired the design, look, and feel of the site, and I took ideas from Lucie's page and created my own thing. No code was copied from the project, only design concepts.

So that said, I was inspired by Lucie's design, but the inspiration for creating a personal website was more my response to going stir-crazy. I have been working independently since 2018 and while that's been nice during the pandemic, I would like to find another niche in the tech industry. The real reason: I miss creating things with other people.
